# OTP Reader helper library

Use this library to do any kind of OTP reading. It currently supports the following methods of SMS reading:

* SMS Receiver
* SMS Inbox Polling

# How to use

### `Aff` vs `Flow`

If you're running in an Aff context, use the functions present in the `Juspay.OTP.Reader` module

If you're running in a `Flow` context, the same functions are either re-exported or wrapped inside `Flow` in the `Juspay.OTP.Reader.Flow` module

### Permissions

If you're using SMS Receiver or SMS inbox poller, you need Android SMS permissions.

Use `getSmsReadPermission` to check if SMS permission has already been granted or not

Use `requestSmsReadPermission` to ask the user for permission (will return false without asking if SMS permission has not been declared in the app's manifest)

### The `getOtpListener` function

This is the main function you'll be using to read OTPs

```purescript
getOtpListener :: Array SmsReader -> Flow OtpListener
```

It takes an array of `SmsReader`s which is the type representing different SMS reading methods.

It returns an `OtpListener` which is a type alias for a record containing 2 functions:

```purescript
type OtpListener = {
  getNextOtp :: Flow (Either Error String),
  setOtpRules :: Array OtpRule -> Flow Unit
}
```

Call the `getNextOtp` function when you want to wait for an OTP. The function will block until a received SMS succeeds OTP extraction.

Call the `setOtpRules` function to set the OTP regex rules that need to be used for extracting the OTP from incoming SMSs.

At first, no OTP rules are set. So calling `getNextOtp` will not return any OTPs even if the correct SMS is received. Instead, it will be internally queued and will be processed only when you call `setOtpRules` for the first time. This is useful in situations where you don't know the bank until _after_ the OTP is triggered but you want to start listening for incoming SMSs as early as possible.

In situations where you already know the bank before the OTP is triggered, you can just call `setOtpRules` first and then `getNextOtp`.

You can call `getNextOtp` as many times as you want (inside a loop for example) to keep listening for OTPs.

### OTP Rules

You can either create your own OTP Rules using the `OtpRule` type or you can get the default bank OTP rules used by Godel through the `getGodelOtpRules` function.

The otp rules are decoded from JS so it can throw a decode error. Handle accordingly

```purescript
-- Get OTP rules for ICICI Debit Cards.
result <- runExcept <$> getGodelOtpRules "ICICIDC"
case result of
  Right otpRules -> pure otpRules
  Left decodeError -> throwError $ "Failed to get OTP rules from Godel: " <> show decodeError
```

Godel's OTP rules are defined in Godel's config.js file under the "otp_rules" field

### Example

```purescript
import Juspay.OTP.Reader.Flow (getGodelOtpRules, getOtpListener, requestSmsReadPermission, smsReceiver, smsPoller)

waitForHDFCOtp = do
  granted <- requestSmsReadPermission
  if not granted then throwError "SMS permission not granted" else pure unit
  otpRulesF <- runExcept <$> getGodelOtpRules "HDFC"
  otpRules <- either (show >>> throwError) (pure) otpRulesF
  otpListener <- getOtpListener [smsReceiver, smsPoller]
  otpListener.setOtpRules otpRules
  triggerOtp
  result <- otpListener.getNextOtp -- blocks until an OTP is received
  case result of
    Right otp -> pure otp
    Left err -> throwError err
```
