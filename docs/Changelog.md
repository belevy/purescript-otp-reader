All versions and their changelogs. The version names are git tags. So if you want to checkout that version's commit, checkout the tag with that name (eg: `git checkout v0.1`).

For a given `vX.X` tag, there might be a `vX.X-purs11` tag which is the same version but in PureScript version 11 in case you need it.
