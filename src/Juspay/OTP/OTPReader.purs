-- |  3. The SMS 'from' field matches one of the `sender` regexes
-- |  4. The OTP part of the SMS body successfuly matches the `otp` regex
-- |  5. If the `otp` regex contains groups, the `group` value references
-- |    a valid group matched by the `otp` regex. (defaults to 0 if `Nothing`)

-- | Waits until an SMS is received that matches one of the given `OtpRule`s.
-- | It works by starting an Android Broadcast Receiver and polling the
-- | SMS inbox at fixed intervals until an SMS is received that matches one
-- | of the supplied OTP rules.
-- |
-- | The first argument is the list of `OtpRule`s of which a received SMS
-- | should match at least one.
-- |
-- | The second argument should be a UNIX timestamp string in milliseconds
-- | which represents the start time the SMS poller should be interested in
-- | when polling for new SMSs.
-- |
-- | The third argument is the frequency at which the SMS poller should check
-- | the Inbox for new messages
-- |
-- | The fourth argument is a list of previously processed SMS hashes used
-- | to prevent a previously processed OTP from being processed again a second
-- | time. When running this function for the first time, pass `noProcessed`.
-- | When the first OTP is extracted from an SMS, the hash of that SMS will
-- | be returned along with the OTP as `ProcessedSms` in the `Result` value.
-- | The next time `getOtp` is called, the previously returned `ProcessedSms`
-- | value can be passed back to this function so that if the same SMS is
-- | found again by the SMS poller, it will be ignored. Every subsequent call
-- | of `getOtp` can be passed a `ProcessedSms` value from the previous run
